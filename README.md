a mortar calcultor for arma 3
this app does not account for enviremental as of right now so it is strictly vaccum if using ACE for wind/temperature events this will not be wholly accurate.
Right now it is only a .py file therefor it cannot run on its own you need python 3.1.0 and IDE or know how ot run it off a commandline
