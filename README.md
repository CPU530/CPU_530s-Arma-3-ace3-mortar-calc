a mortar calcultor for arma 3
this app does not account for enviremental circimstances as of right now so it is strictly vaccum if using ACE for wind/temperature events this will not be wholly accurate.
Right now it is only a .py file therefor it cannot run on its own you need python 3.1.0 (What it was made on) and IDE or know how ot run it off a commandline

despite what it says the program can take 6digit grids but i strongly recomend that you do not use them as a area tha tis 100mx100m is rather larger to be firing in when getting and 8digit can narrow your accuaracy down quite alot small effort for big bump in results
